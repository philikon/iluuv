TODO:

* Batching to scale long search results (auto-load on scrolling down)

* There are several situations where it would make sense to abort an
  AJAX request (e.g. switching views prematurely).

Enhancement Ideas:

* Cache icons in localStorage (render them down to 48x48 using canvas
  and store the canvas's data URL)

* Allow login via OpenID

* Automatic status msgs on twitter

* Most luuved items (easy)

* Users who luuved this also luuved ABC, XYZ, ... (harder)

* Here are some users who luuv similar things (hard)
